# OS-Project_1
Simulation of Gang Scheduling algorithms, Adapted First Come First Serve and Largest Gang First Served algorithms with and without arrival times. Without arrival time, all jobs are assumed to arrive at time t=0. Largest Gang First Served algorithm with arrival times and Adapted First Come First Served are both implemented in Non-Preemptive manner.
